- **Streaming:** Real-time response generation
- **Error Handling:** Retries, exponential backoff
- **Rate Limiting:** Managing API quotas
- **Token Management:** Counting, optimization, cost control

### Function Calling
- **Tool Definition:** Describing external functions
- **Parameter Schemas:** JSON schema for inputs
- **Response Handling:** Processing function results
- **Error Management:** Handling function failures
- **Multi-Step Workflows:** Chaining function calls

### Structured Outputs
- **JSON Mode:** Guaranteed JSON responses

## Resources

### Required Materials
- Week 3 lesson materials (in `lessons/` folder)
- Jupyter notebooks for labs (in `labs/` folder)
- Exercise templates (in `exercises/` folder)

### Additional Resources
- OpenAI API Reference Documentation
- OpenAI Cookbook (examples repository)
- Function Calling Guide
- JSON Schema Documentation

### Tools & Libraries
```python
openai>=1.0.0
tiktoken
pydantic>=2.0.0
python-dotenv
tenacity  # For retries
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: CoT Not Working
**Problem:** Model doesn't follow step-by-step reasoning  
**Solution:** Explicitly instruct "think step by step", provide examples, use lower temperature

### Challenge 2: Function Calling Errors
**Problem:** Model doesn't call functions correctly  
**Solution:** Improve function descriptions, validate schemas, provide examples in system message

### Challenge 3: Rate Limits
**Problem:** API requests fail with rate limit errors  
**Solution:** Implement exponential backoff, use tenacity for retries, batch requests

### Challenge 4: High Token Costs
**Problem:** API usage exceeds budget  
**Solution:** Optimize prompts, cache results, use cheaper models when appropriate, implement token limits

## Deliverables

By the end of Week 3, participants should have:

1. **CoT Reasoning System** - Implementation for complex problem-solving
2. **API Integration Module** - Robust OpenAI API wrapper with error handling
3. **Function Calling Assistant** - Tool-augmented chatbot
4. **Production Prompt Library** - Reusable, production-ready prompts
