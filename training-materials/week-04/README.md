## Key Concepts

### RAG Architecture
- **Retrieval:** Finding relevant documents
- **Augmentation:** Adding context to prompts
- **Generation:** LLM produces answer with context
- **End-to-end flow:** Query → Retrieve → Augment → Generate

### Embeddings
- **Vector Representations:** Converting text to numbers
- **Semantic Similarity:** Finding related content
- **Embedding Models:** OpenAI, Sentence Transformers, etc.
- **Dimensionality:** Understanding vector spaces

### Vector Databases
- **Storage:** Efficient vector storage and indexing
- **Search:** K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search
- **Popular Options:** Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS
- **Metadata Filtering:** Combining vector search with filters

### Document Processing
- **Chunking:** Breaking documents into manageable pieces
- **Overlap:** Maintaining context across chunks
- **Metadata:** Tracking source, page, timestamps
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and formatting text

## Assessment Criteria

### Knowledge Check
- Understanding of RAG architecture and flow
- Knowledge of embedding concepts and vector search
- Familiarity with document processing techniques
- Awareness of RAG limitations and solutions

- Exercise templates (in `exercises/` folder)
- Sample documents for testing

### Additional Resources
- LangChain RAG Tutorial
- Vector Database Documentation
- Research papers on RAG
- OpenAI Embeddings Guide

### Tools & Libraries
```python
openai>=1.0.0
langchain>=0.1.0
chromadb>=0.4.0  # or pinecone-client, weaviate-client
tiktoken
pypdf2  # For PDF processing
python-dotenv
```

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Poor Retrieval Quality
**Problem:** System retrieves irrelevant documents  
**Solution:** Improve chunking strategy, optimize embeddings, add metadata filtering, use hybrid search

### Challenge 2: Context Window Limits
**Problem:** Retrieved documents exceed token limits  
**Solution:** Implement smarter chunking, rank and select top chunks, use summarization

### Challenge 3: Slow Performance
**Problem:** System is too slow for production use  
**Solution:** Optimize vector database indexing, cache embeddings, use batch processing

### Challenge 4: Hallucinations Still Occur
**Problem:** Model makes up information despite RAG  
**Solution:** Improve prompt instructions, add citation requirements, implement fact-checking, adjust retrieval parameters

## Deliverables

By the end of Week 4, participants should have:

1. **Basic RAG System** - Working document Q&A implementation
2. **Enterprise RAG** - Production-ready system with error handling
3. **Evaluation Framework** - Metrics and testing for RAG quality
4. **Best Practices Guide** - Documentation of learnings and patterns
