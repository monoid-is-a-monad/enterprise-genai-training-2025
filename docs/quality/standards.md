# Quality Standards

## Overview

This document defines the quality standards for all training materials in the Enterprise GenAI Training Program.

## Learning Design Principles

### 1. Clear Learning Objectives
Every training session must have:
- **Specific:** Clearly defined outcomes
- **Measurable:** Assessable through exercises or tests
- **Achievable:** Realistic within the allocated time
- **Relevant:** Aligned with program goals
- **Time-bound:** Completable within the session

### 2. Bloom's Taxonomy Alignment
Content should progress through cognitive levels:
- **Remember:** Recall key concepts
- **Understand:** Explain ideas in own words
- **Apply:** Use concepts in new situations
- **Analyze:** Break down complex systems
- **Evaluate:** Make informed judgments
- **Create:** Build original solutions

### 3. Adult Learning Principles
- **Relevance:** Connect to real-world applications
- **Experience:** Build on existing knowledge
- **Problem-centered:** Focus on solving actual problems
- **Autonomy:** Allow self-directed exploration
- **Feedback:** Provide immediate, constructive feedback

## Content Quality Criteria

### Technical Accuracy
- ✅ All code examples are tested and working
- ✅ Concepts align with industry best practices
- ✅ Information is current (within 6 months)
- ✅ Sources are cited and verifiable
- ✅ Technical terminology is used correctly

### Clarity & Comprehension
- ✅ Complex concepts broken into digestible parts
- ✅ Consistent terminology throughout
- ✅ Clear examples and analogies
- ✅ Visual aids enhance understanding
- ✅ Progressive complexity (simple → advanced)

### Engagement
- ✅ Interactive elements included
- ✅ Real-world case studies
- ✅ Hands-on practice opportunities
- ✅ Variety in teaching methods
- ✅ Opportunities for collaboration

### Accessibility
- ✅ Multiple learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- ✅ Clear, readable fonts and layouts
- ✅ Sufficient contrast ratios
- ✅ Alternative text for images
- ✅ Closed captions for videos

## Material Specifications

### Slide Presentations
**Requirements:**

import openai

def process_data(input_data: List[str]) -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Process input data and return results.
    
    Args:
        input_data: List of strings to process
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary containing processed results
        
    Example:
        >>> data = ["hello", "world"]
        >>> result = process_data(data)
        >>> print(result)
        {'count': 2, 'items': ['hello', 'world']}
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```
